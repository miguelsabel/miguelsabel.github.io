## Hi, my name is Miguel Sabel

I love cooking and eating. I try to go running every morning. I have two daughters. I miss the internet. I am from Galicia.

I design new businesses, products and services at Designit. Before that, I spent some time in a small design publisher and studio and in a technological innovation consultancy. I love teaching.

My email is miguel@sabel.me. You can also find me on Linkedin, Twitter, Medium or Instagram.
